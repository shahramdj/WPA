A Wearable Personal Assistant (WPA) for orthopedic surgeons
To investigate the opportunities and challenges of using smart glasses at hospitals, I developed and evaluated a prototype of Wearable Personal Assistant (WPA) for orthopedic surgeons. The prototype was developed on Google Glass. I evaluated the WPA prototype in three different scenarios as follows:

1- Touchless interaction in operation room through head movements and voice commands

2- Telepresence sessions in operation room between a remote expert and a local surgeon

3- Mobile access to the patient records during ward rounds
